# Alpha-Build
Files from Unreal Engine 4, Blender, and Sculptris, for Desolation's Alpha Build.
Currently exclusive access to Developers only, not to be redistributed. Acessed files may not play, or will crash frequently until reaching a more stable release point.

<b>User Introduction</b>
<br>In Desolation, you and other players control a native lifeform called a Naih, as you try to live and survive in alien and unforgiving situations. A hostile mysterious world, filled with danger, adventure, and reward is yours to explore: a moon named Aros orbiting a gas giant, not unlike Jupiter, in a foreign solar system.
The Online Multiplayer, Open-World, 3D Simulation's goal is to subject the player to new conditions foreign to what they have learned on earth. Unlike most games, Desolation recognises the human conscious controls the player pawn, and will psychologically use your humanity to challenge and take advantage of you as a creature with human tendencies. It will be essential for you to adapt in order to survive.
The game will also include a hidden plot line which is discovered by finding locations and piecing messages and clues together. Nothing in the game will be handed to you aside from basic tutorial information, it is up to you to learn what is a friend or a foe, what is prey and predator, and to uncover the dark history of what exactly happened on Aros 200 yrs ago if you so choose.
<br><i>Will you evolve into the next sentient life of Aros? Or will you and the Naih species meet desolation....</i>
